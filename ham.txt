(If you remember, the default was something the TeaParty strongly supported, and didn’t think would be so bad).\n3) Congress passed a bi-partisan budget agreement to raise spending and mitigate the automatic “sequester” cuts. (Again, something the TeaParty strongly supported keeping). \n4) The GOP-Controlled House has just passed a new Farm Bill, which will renew agriculture subsidies and increase spending on “Food Stamps.” \n\nWhile you can argue that the House only passed the “clean” debt ceiling increase over the majority of Republicans, you can’t say the same thing about the Spending Agreement and the Farm Bill.  The GOP voted in the majority for those bills.  \nThe TeaParty is losing it’s grip (both on Congress, and on Reality itself). \nI, for one, am glad to see them go. \n\nSo, TeaParty-backed Steve Stockman walked out of the SOTU?  Good, don’t let the door hit you where the good lord split you.\n"}

This isn't something that can be dumbed down into \"Regulation all good/regulation all bad.\"  The fact is that the technology Uber uses has completely invalidated the any legitimate rationale behind taxi cab regulation beyond what Uber currently adheres to (background checks, proof of insurance, etc.).  The reason we have special fees and licenses for cabs is because they operate in public view as a mobile store front.  That way when someone steps off a plane in your city, they won't hop in some random joker's marked car pretending to be an official mode of public transportation.  That doesn't apply to Uber.  Uber X rides are all privately arranged and contracted beforehand.  The cars are unmarked and they do not patron people off the street.  That is why any attempt to place the same restrictions that a cab company has to deal with is nothing but baseless corruption and protectionism of an obsolete business model.\n"}

The \"war on drugs\" was redeclared by Bush with a \nhuge government-media propaganda campaign just in time to provide a \npretext for the invasion of Panama to kidnap\na thug who was convicted in Florida for crimes mostly committed when he \nwas in CIA payroll--incidentally killing unknown numbers of poor people \nin the bombarded slums, thousands according to Panamanian human rights \ninvestigators, but there was no\nUS inquiry: \"We don't do body counts,\" as explained by General Tommy \nFranks, the conqueror of Iraq. The \"war on drugs\" also had an important \ndomestic component. Much like the \"war on crime,\" it served to frighten \nthe population into obedience.\nThe alleged threat was later transmuted from Drugsto narcoterrorism, \nexploiting opportunities offered by 9/11. By the end of the millennium, \ntotal US military and police assistance in the hemisphere already \nexceeded economic and social aid.\nSource: http://www.ontheissues.org/Hopes_Prospects.htm\n, Jun 1, 2010\n"}

Would be glad to see the BCS schools break away, leave the NCAA and never participate against another NCAA school again. Then they can't buy wins from the Savannah States of the world, are stuck playing each other all the time, and then Michigan realizes that it's stuck sharing its money with schools like Iowa State, Wake Forest, Washington State and Vanderbilt, schools who have far more in common with an East Carolina or BYU than they do with Michigan.\n"}

I understand majority of Australians do not know what happened to Aboriginal people and how they were transported and segregated, suffered from introduced diseases, their children were taken away, and they were killed like animals in mass genocide in clear land for cattle farming (what our country was built on). They were not recognised as being human by the government, only as \"fauna\" native to this land. It was only in 1960's were Aboriginal Australians officially able to vote, or even be allowed within city boundaries after dark. I know these things because I am 5th generation aboriginal australian and I have seen where my great-great grandmothers people were slaughtered while sleeping and visited their graves. When I talk to my friends about what happened to my ancestors and show them pictures of the places where they were segregated and killed, they understand how that would have crushed them and their identity. There has always been an \"us\" and \"them\" mentality towards aboriginal people, and aboriginal people have been pushed away, been made to feel ashamed, and swept under the carpet for generations. There needs to be more education and empathy around what happened to aboriginals in this country, because so many injustices have happened, even in my mother's time. It is only until you can understand the past, that you can move on together and heal and build a new and brighter future.\n"}

Does this mean they shouldn't as a Global company invest in their other assembly plants? Do you really think that Honda is not getting their wire harnesses from Mexico and China like the everyone else? Do you think any Brazilian made Honda's are coming here? Just because they have a plant there doesn't they are sending them here! If I lived in Japan should I be mad that more Hondas are made out the country than in it? I think that is true for most big car companies. \n\nGLOBAL Production\n8.9ish million VW's were made last year. How many were in Germany?\n12ish million Toyota's were made. How many were made in Japan?\n4.5ish million Honda's were made. You get the point. Are we Japans Mexico? How does that make you feel?    \nKey word is investment. As with investors they invest their money in something and hope to turn a profit from it in the future.   \n\nI work for a company that makes goods in the states. We have vendors and suppliers that we buy from to put in our product. One of our suppliers moved their production to Mexico from Mass. They did this so they could make more profit and keep the costs low to us. We had no control over this. Hondas are not made in the US for the sake of being made here. They are made here because it is cheaper than making them in Japan. That is it that is all. If there was more profit in building it in Japan and shipping it here then that is what they would be doing.     \n\nYes GM invested in Mexico as well as other countries as a global company should (Honda does). However GM just invested 500mil not in a country but one truck plant in TX. They pumped a total of 2.8billion of plant investment into the US for 2013. Not defending GM they have their faults. I have no dislike for Honda either I think it's a fine car company even owned a few. I just have a dislike for comments like \"Most\" when its not the chase, \"GM is expanding to Brazil\" news flash they have been there since 1930. So I'm going to guess before you were born.\n"}

The reality is that he's got a lot of injuries stacked up and we don't know how long he can play the rugged style that has made him effective.  We may have seen signs of wear this season as he came back from injury playing soft for a while.  Seems to be better now and I hope we can keep him.  Not sure what would be fair under the cap structure.  On a championship team he would be about the best 3rd line winger in the league.  Here he's 1st or 2nd line.  If they could build up the core and pay him to stay as a 3rd liner and that would be awesome but not sure it's realistic.\n"}

Why not choose to be Straight, then? Just think of how much easier things would be. You wouldn't have to worry about coming out to your friends and family members, at the risk of possibly being rejected by them. You wouldn't have to worry about losing your job or being kicked out of a rental property. You'd never have to worry about being beaten up or killed if some thug caught you coming out of a Gay bar. Rather than being told that you aren't allowed to marry the person you love, and that if you do, you might be turned away by businesses while planning the wedding, you could just marry a woman and live happily ever after and be celebrated by all your conservative friends and family members. Life would be so much easier, wouldn't it?\n\nBut no. Instead, you play right into the hands of all the people who to insist that, for the rest of the LGBT world, choosing to be Gay is little more than a capricious flouting of convention.\n"}

He goes to junior college and no more OF maybe pitched a little, but mostly 1B. Transferred to Texas and I think only played 1B, though I could be off on that. He has completely reinvented himself as a gap hitter with power, the ability to get on base, and a very good defensive 1B. He is a Giants success story.\n"}

{"comment_id":"content_134212949","time":"20140129223344Z","id":"content_134212949","content":"Parmi les choses qui me font râler aujourd'hui il y a cet incroyable avertissement que le CSA a adressé à Canal + suite à la diffusion, dans le cadre de l'émission « Le Débarquement », d'un sketch parodiant à la fois  « Rendez-vous en terre inconnue » et « La parenthèse inattendue ». J'avais déjà réagi sous la tribune de Scholastique Mukasonga publiée dans Libération il y a quelques jours car j'estimais qu'il fallait relativiser et prendre ce sketch pour ce qu'il était, à savoir non pas « l'innocence tranquille du racisme ordinaire » comme l'avait perçu la romancière mais plutôt une charge satirique contre les sociétés occidentales et en particulier ces émissions qui versent dans le misérabilisme pour faire de l'audience.\n\nEn ces temps où l'on parle de liberté d'expression certains ont à mon avis la gâchette bien trop sensible (même si c'est parfois, comme pour Dieudonné, justifié) et ont tendance à pointer leurs flingues sur des cibles qui n'en méritent pas tant. Je pense qu'il ne faut pas voir le mal partout, et surtout pas là où il n'est pas car c'est probablement plus contre-productif qu'autre chose. Le risque est que les rares émissions humoristiques qui passent encore à la télévision soient non seulement encore plus rares mais qu'elles soient en plus édulcorées en se soumettant à une forme de bien-pensance que nous avons quitté au fil des années avec bien trop de plaisir pour lui laisser à nouveau le champ libre.\n\n\nhttp://www.liberation.fr/monde/2014/01/29/canal-mis-en-demeure-par-le-csa-pour-un-sketch-sur-le-rwanda_976374\nhttp://www.liberation.fr/monde/2013/12/29/canal-a-mourir-de-rire_969525"}

The idea of tossing a so-so veteran into the mix just for the sake of having a veteran around doesn't make much sense. For every old guy you add to the rotation, a young guy gets squeezed out of his chance to show his stuff.\n"}

Lebron James is pretty much unanimously considered the best all-around player in the game, yet he has never gotten to all three of those lofty totals in one half-season. The only other players to get there in the last 25 years: Shaq, David Robinson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone, and Charles Barkley. That's some pretty damn good company.\"\nWOW\n"}

In \n2012, Google completed its acquisition of Motorola Mobility for $12.5 \nbillion.  At the time, it was thought that the primary reason for the acquisition \nwas the treasure trove of Motorola patents that would help Google defend\n it and its partners against Apple. The patents, however, have proven to be less than effective in warding \noff lawsuits, and much of the legal fighting as gone on between Apple \nand Samsung, with Google only tangentially related.\"\nCouldn't the fact that Google has only been tangentially targeted in lawsuits be a *result* of purchasing the Motorola patents?  And don't the patents that they retain continue to hold a significant value?\n"}

Regardless, he has been suffering this for 4-5 years now.  \n\nIt is just a matter of time before Nadal also succumbs to this.  Those thinking he can continue his production as it has been until the end of his career, meaning easily surpassing Rogers 17, need to consider more seriously this phenomenon, common to sports in general, no matter how distasteful this thought might be to them.\n"}

Judge Snow was not clear on that and Joe is taking advantage of that. it is an intentional act of defiance, but it is being made using a loophole in the Judge not being more precise in his orders. but since it is such an obvious act of defiance because of the judge not being clear enough............expect Joe and his legal team to be called in for a redefining of those rules. Joe found a loophole and used it, i dont think the judge can punish him for it (maybe he can), but he will not be giving Joe another opportunity to flaunt his defiance\n"}

Have swooped in with some likes, but haven't seen enough other stuff to have anything to add. Had a medical procedure this morning and napped all afternoon! It was a little nasty and the Xanax and local anesthetic didn't begin to cut it, but it was brief! Will know results Monday, but should be fine.\n\n\nAlso had a lot to do - nothing for weeks, than all stacked up in ten days! That was fun stuff, but cut into my time to hang out. By the time I came by, long discussions with Terry or colly and I ignore those.\n\n\nExpect to be back to normal posting soon. Thanks so much for asking!\n\n\nDid see in my e-mail  lovely post from hivemaster saying something like all the lands in the realm still belong to Queen Ivy! ;) That was cheery!\n\n\nAlso fell asleep before end of SOTU and missed all the repub responses! Happy thing!\n\n\nThanks all. Back soon.\n"}

That said, not every builds are viable in pvp, so i can understand why some people would want to be protected against invasion. Plus, they REALLY need to rework how backstab and parry/counter works. In my experience, If your build/strategy doesn't revolve around backstab your chance of success in pvp drops (to say the least). For exemple, my str/high poise character get his ass kicked in pvp but my mobile dex build is doing quite good.\n"}

They are refined-sugar-gluten-dairy-FREE! *************This week if you (please!) donate between $7-$25 dollars to my campaign, Food For Healing: Raising Tuition for Natural Chef Culinary Program, I will send  you some of these AMAZING cups.

It's a big deal because it means I will be able to learn the tools I need to continue cooking using food as preventative medicine and learn to have my own business and career in it. I will be able to bring you more recipes, AND take on clients. I want to work with people who have suffered from chronic illness, and those who are interested in changing their lives and lifestyle through food... realizing that it is the root of health.  My campaign has many \"perks\" including baskets of goodies and recipes. PLEASE CHECK IT OUT. This is my most honest dream and know it is my lifes work. I have never been so certain. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>http://igg.me/at/Natural-Chef-Pearl/x/5985036  Much love! <3\n"}

At least that's what we were told at the time.\nSo now we reject the home of soccer so the new Adelaide Oval can make some money. Of course the regular sponsors will be replaced by FIFA-approved i.e FIFA-paying ones, so the only winners will be the soccer tragics who call it football. Note \"football\" is the majority code as played in that are. So football in the US is gridiron, in NSW it's rugby league and here it is Aussie Rules.\n"}

True Neapolitan pizza is a different animal with a different range of ingredients, but it's lost on spaghetti-and-meatballers like yourself who wouldn't know mozzarella from Cheeze Whiz. If you want to waste your time sitting in your South Florida condo convincing yourself that the lousy pizza from Garden Terrace was actually edible, that's your business, but your \"Tales of the South Bronx\" don't impress anyone except your grand kids."}

That's how badly your credibility is going to be blown. Go ahead and rant now, paolo, while you still have the chance, because time is on our side. Yes it is. \n2) Anyone who still obsesses about Clark the mascot or Theo's salary has no right to call anyone a dunce, period. \n3) \"They needed 6 or 8 of them ready to go NOW!!!\" Reminds me of the old joke: two economists stranded on a desert island with nothing but a crate of canned food. First economist says to the other one: \"I have a solution. First, assume we have a can opener....\" Our FO operates in the real world. That puts them at a distinct disadvantage when compared to us."}

They got rich off proving it. Besides, I doubt many pirates even play the games they pirate and store away, just like people collect Steam games they don't play.\n\nNext, this isn't an article about Titanfall for Xbox One. This is specifically talking about Xbox One controller support. It was always coming to PC as it's a Microsoft exclusive.\n\nLastly, I'm curious about the differences between PC and console. I'll need more information before I choose. They say no cloud for the PC version. I always play PC games with a controller if viable, but games like Battlefield aren't really possible to play with a controller as infantry. It works better for all vehicles, but infantry combat would require keyboard and mouse if you don't want to lose every gunfight."}

Particularly they seem to be reluctant to do so, ever since\nReagan-and-Thatcher assumed the supreme reign of power in the Anglo-Saxon’s\npolitical realm. \nBut, before we go to address that issue, let me add an anecdote\nor two about the importance of what in ugly terms is call the “Social Capital” (namely\ngood family unit) and what impact it could play in the public square. \nAnd, by that I mean, my father was a working class industrial\nmechanist, who used to work in a various heavy factories in Lancashire in\n1950/60s/70s. Secondly, although,  we\nwere not poor, but still, there were many nights whereby all six of his\nchildren (we were big family) went to bed with nothing to eat other than what\nwe had at school at the lunch time. Furthermore, all that being the case, he still\nkept his family together at best he could. Of course, our mother (blessed her\nheart) did heroic job in keeping everything ticking over, particularly in order\nto make sure that what little money my father earns as his weekly wages could go\na long way for the family. \nThirdly, despite all of that hardship, every one of\nhis children (all six of us) turned out to be a middle class by profession.\nAnd, by that I mean, in the sense that the elder sun becoming a Doctor, the\nsecond one a Lawyer, the third one an Academic, the fourth one an Accountant,\nand the last two one (a boy and a girl), are finishing their PhDs soon. \nSo, in a sense a social capital (or a cohesive family unit) is very important for social\nupward mobility. However, here is where I think the right (a political species\nnot much given in thinking in-terms of “economical determinism” and what impact\nit does to society like most left-of-centre folks like me do) are wrong. \nYou\nsee if it wasn’t for the various heavy industrial factories that were in business\nin Lancashire region between 1950s till late 1970s, my father would have never\nhad a decent way to bring up his family. For, he would have been just another “dole-queue-claimant”\n(with all that would mean for his dignity and self-respect). \nHence, even as poor man, my father, could still look at us in\nthe eye and tell us (all of his six children) that the bread we eat he – alone -\nprovides it by the sweat of his hand on a weekly basis. And, in that lays, I\nbelieve, a man’s salvation of his dignity in his eyes as well as given him all the\n“moral assuredness” he needs to keep his family together under one roof. \nHowever, since the “Neo-liberal economical policies” in\nwhich the right favours ever since Reagan-and-Thatcher, came to being, it meant\nthat effectively all of those working-class factory work has been eviscerated in\nthe bulk of Northern region of England as well as Scotland and in Wales. Hence,\nwith it, those long gone factory/working-class jobs took a devastating toll on “support-system” in\nwhich the bulk of the working class and their families could of rely on to keep\ntheir families together.\nConsequently, I am afraid, you are wrong to say that a family\nbreak-down has contributed the collapse of “social capital” (or family unit) and with it had\nincrease social immobility amongst the poor and the working class.\nAnd the reason I say that, is that, on the contrary, the increasing\ninequality, the stagnant wages, the backwards trends in social mobility, are\nall of a direct results of the economical policies in which Anglo-Saxon’s world\nhas been pursuing ever since late 1970s.\nTherefore, the break-down of family\n(or even the pronounced lack of “family formation” in the former industrial\nheartland of UK and USA) are essentially the “symptoms” as opposed to them being the “cause” of\nwhat has been going on.\nAll in all, the folks in the \"political right\" (like you) may have finally \"diagnosed\" of what is\ngoing on with the society-at-large. And that is a welcome news at the moment. But, still, the\n\"real villain\" of the piece that account for all of the “symptoms”, namely, the family break-down, stagnant wages, increasing inequality, lack of social\nmobility, could be place at the feat of the policies in which\nReagan and Thatcher have championed to the larger detriment of society as a\nwhole.\n"}

Hence,\nwith it, those long gone factory/working-class jobs took a devastating toll on “support-system” in\nwhich the bulk of the working class and their families could of rely on to keep\ntheir families together.\nConsequently, I am afraid, you are wrong to say that a family\nbreak-down has contributed the collapse of “social capital” (or family unit) and with it had\nincrease social immobility amongst the poor and the working class.\nAnd the reason I say that, is that, on the contrary, the increasing\ninequality, the stagnant wages, the backwards trends in social mobility, are\nall of a direct results of the economical policies in which Anglo-Saxon’s world\nhas been pursuing ever since late 1970s.\nTherefore, the break-down of family\n(or even the pronounced lack of “family formation” in the former industrial\nheartland of UK and USA) are essentially the “symptoms” as opposed to them being the “cause” of\nwhat has been going on.\nAll in all, the folks in the \"political right\" (like you) may have finally \"diagnosed\" of what is\ngoing on with the society-at-large. And that is a welcome news at the moment. But, still, the\n\"real villain\" of the piece that account for all of the “symptoms”, namely, the family break-down, stagnant wages, increasing inequality, lack of social\nmobility, could be place at the feat of the policies in which\nReagan and Thatcher have championed to the larger detriment of society as a\nwhole.\n"}

Judge Snow was not clear on that and Joe is taking advantage of that. it is an intentional act of defiance, but it is being made using a loophole in the Judge not being more precise in his orders. but since it is such an obvious act of defiance because of the judge not being clear enough............expect Joe and his legal team to be called in for a redefining of those rules. Joe found a loophole and used it, i dont think the judge can punish him for it (maybe he can), but he will not be giving Joe another opportunity to flaunt his defiance. i will give Joe credit for using the loophole to his advantage, but i am not going to fool myself into thinking it was anything other than an intentional thumb to the nose to the court"}

People listen to his music and either like it or don't. He never had responsibility for whatever Stalin did. If you are going to start to take names of those who remained silent when abuses occurred under their noses, you better have a big notebook. As I said earlier, Ronald Reagan was not only silent about the abuses the Contras were proved guilty of (and Reagan certainly knew all the human rights groups who were complaining), but he also actively supported them and funded them. And he was so adamant about supporting them, he did it illegally. And you were the one who brought up Nicaragua in this article, it wasn't me.\nSo get off your sanctimonious horse, unless of course you want to name names of people who only wished they had remained silent about evil rather than actively support it."}

They thank him for his contribution to those WS teams. \nThose who booed him are bunch of cry babies and bandwagon fans. I can understand not re-signing him even though JD tried to bring him back for 4 years. Let's not act like we didn't want him to begin with. Rangers wanted him for 3 to 4 years and Josh wanted that extra year. \nI will never fully understand those fans with short memory who booed Josh out of town.\n"}

So all this time you became a millionaire investing in the wrong f\\-\\cking stock. Yeah right...Ahahahahaaaaaa.\nThird, you said \"Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't the whole idea of extracting maximum profits by exploiting labor what every business doing?\"  Yeah you ARE wrong.  You extract maximum profit by making sound and, wait for it... ethical business decisions.  There is a reason we have labor laws in this country.  While it's true that not all businesses follow the law, I'm sure you wouldn't want your mother, your sister, your son\\daughter, as examples, to be one of those being exploited by the very businesses that do.  If you are telling me that you are perfectly fine with having someone you personally know be exploited in that way, not only are you a moron, but an inhuman degenerate that deserves to be exploited yourself.  \nSo keep on investing in APPL.  You'll be panhandling in some subway and I will laugh at you when I see you.  Heck, I'm laughing at you now...JERK."}

Not in a way, that everyone who would see you wearing it, would look twice at it, or give (stupid) comments, BUT the SUBTLE differences, which at least I did not see until now in other watches. To name a few, that caught my eye instantly:\n\n1. The unusual position of the date indicator;\n2. The 10x10 (if my count is correct) carved-in (so it appears on the picture) grid on the black 'dial' (my English is not perfect) under the sapphire crystal - a pretty unique feature;\n3. Rose gold toned bezel, which is something not really unique by itself, but added with the six silver coloured unusually positioned \"screws\" (again I apologise for my English) it CERTAINLY is;\n4. The CONTRAST (not only between colours, but also between the angled bezel and round dial).\n\nAs for the other time-pieces, I'm a little short on money and knowledge :) , but I DO VERY MUCH like the 'timeless' ORIENT automatic watches, especially those in the little higher price range and those which have a POWER-RESERVE indicator.\n\nP.S.\nThanx to Your site, I 'discovered' the ORIENT brand and I'm  for a few months now a 'proud' owner of one of their more affordable watches (it had a very reasonable price tag for an automatic watch, which features include sapphire crystal and the power-reserve indicator I mentioned above).\n"}

{"comment_id":"content_134215614","time":"20140129224419Z","id":"content_134215614","content":"mary.waterton  I think you're confused.  According to federal surveys, more high school seniors are smoking pot now than cigarettes.  It's already super easy for them to get.  It's not that hard for them to get alcohol either. Many drink, even though it's illegal for them to purchase or possess alcoholic beverages. Even though pot is illegal for anyone to posses or purchase or sell, older teens have been reporting for years on these surveys that it is as easy or easier for them to get pot than it is for them to get alcohol. So those inclined get it now easily, and they'll get it later too. Those not inclined to smoke pot won't, just like they don't know. All that really changes is that those that do get pot will be getting it like they get their beer, buying it with a fake ID or having an older friend or relative buy it for them rather than from drug dealers who in many cases will offer them far worse than just pot. \n\nLegalization actually helps protect our children.  If you can't see that it's just because you don't want to face reality. You want to turn this into some liberal vs. conservative nonsense.  Is that because you are afraid to think for yourself?  You want some other yahoos making your mind up for you?  If you set all that aside and really looked into this and really thought about it you would see that we are doing far more harm than good with this ridiculously expensive failed prohibition that stops nothing, that causes every problem caused by our failed experiment with alcohol prohibition and more, that does this nation far more harm than good.  There is not a darned thing conservative about this big government mess and regardless of your political persuasion you ought to be against this prohibition because it's wrongheaded and wasteful and expensive and entirely ineffective and it does cause an awful lot of harm while not doing a lick of good.\n"}

It allows me to stream to my PC and mobile devices, but it also lets me \"download\" music to a device (I use iPhone and iPod touch) which I can play without an Internet connection. I find this useful for the iPod touch which only has a wifi connection; it's good in the car and on walks/hikes. \nRhapsody had horrendous software for years, and although they seem to be market laggards, it's a good service and the Web interface is light years better than the old software. \nI'm a music artifact junkie (78s, 45s, cassettes, LPs, CDs) but I've adjusted to listening to music I don't \"own.\"\nHowever, I've been having a problem lately with the streaming service. Songs frequently drop out, like every song! I reported it to Rhapsody, but their answer was reboot, sign in, then sign out of Rhapsody, then reset my browser to default settings. Great guys. I think they have sucky servers because I stream Pandora or Rdio with no problems. \nSo, my question is: which of the other services lets you \"download\" to listen offline, in addition to the streaming service? I'd love to hear about users' experiences. \nIf this don't get better, I'm gonna leave Rhapsody.\n"}

This still left the V6, and to an extent the turbo4, at a handicap in their price bracket.  That combined with the new V6's hp being overrated, just leaves a bad taste with me.\nNow, another price bump?  It's cruise control for crying out loud, there's no reason a near $30k car shouldn't have already had it.  It's 2014 people, start expecting more.\nI want to love the Genesis, I really do, but those that want to buy one need re-examine this overpriced machine.\n"}

Almost every time you saw footage of a game developer they had Xbox 360 controllers on the desk. I hope the extra poser of the PS4 doesn't go mostly unused like it did last Gen.\n"}

Workers must compete\nfor jobs by working for less (the Obama economy & low wages).\n3)When demand for labor is high and the supply of\nlabor is low (low unemployment) the $price$ of labor is high. Employers must\ncompete for workers by offering higher starting wages (Example: Bakken North\nDakota & high wages).\nSummary:\nWhen the Federal government forces employers to pay higher starting wages while\ndemand for labor is low employers must use their limited supply of money to\nmake payroll. If there is not enough to cover the cost they must reduce the\nsize of the workforce. This increase the supply of labor with reduced demand.\nThe best and most effective way to raise wages is through\nincreasing demand for labor. Obama could do this today by approving the\nKeystone Pipeline as well as other projects that develop our natural resources.\nUnfortunately, he is more interested in pursuing a political agenda than doing\nwhat is right for ALL of America.\n"}

It has always been stupid and it just proved how stupid, when Bentaleb repeatedly gave the ball to the Citizens over and over and over again. It was worse than AVB starting Lamela against City last time around. Then he takes Dembele off (who I suspect was injured) and puts the guy who he's been icing on and whaddya know! HE SCORES! Not only that he fulfilled his defensive duties, which is his main job. Something Bentaleb seems to not know how to do as a central DEFENSIVE midfielder. Oh, and we should've gone with the 4-4-2. Soldado can't score, but he can pick a pass and we lack creativity today. No points, movin' on\n\nGO SPURS!!!\n"}

They start out and run a prescribed route until one of them needs to refuel/recharge. Then they turn around, as soon as they are ready, not waiting for the other, and return to the starting point. Or how about just run as far as they can go on a tank of gas/charge? The winner is, the Corvette. Considering MT's airport run in a Leaf, who wants to sit around for 45-60 minutes, to recharge, no matter how great the Tesla S is, otherwise? Someday they may both be electrics. Let's hope not. And I do agree with jwoj also."}

I just watched last nights \"Shahs of Sunset\" Yes, I know this is a horrible show but what else am I going to do being stuck in this house avoiding my taxes :) The cast went to Turkey to have a family reunion. Now, I am not a fan of Asa, but when she put a bag of dirt from Iran on her heart that her Auntie had brought to her, I began to cry. \nMy reaction really surprised me. I'm not a weepy kinda of girl. There is something about knowing that I have never set foot on my father's land that pulls at me. \nNow this is where it gets interesting. I started googling tours to Iran when my phone rings and it is my 22 yr old niece asking if Iran has a national flower. I maybe get one call a year so this is a surprise. She is searching to connect with her heritage, searching for a way to honor all sides of her family lines in a tattoo. Then she goes on to tell me how much she is feeling the pull to go to Iran even though she is only a little bit Persian. \nSo this feeling is in the air. The feeling of wanting to honor our ancestors. The feeling of giving thanks to our parents and those who held them and the places they lived. Those roads that have led us to where we find ourselves today, this very moment and to help the next generation to remember.\n"}

Last year the Sox were dominate over the Rays, Tigers and the Cards in the postseason.  All 3 were considered to have the best rotations in Baseball and the Sox dominated them.  Now the Sox rotation will be even stronger and deeper. Also the bullpen will be deeper. The Sox have about a dozen prospects to add to the staff and some of those prospects have already proved that they belong, ie, Workman who isn't mentioned as a top prospect compared to the others held his own down the stretch and in the post-season. They should trade Peavy or Dempster after the season starts when teams find that they have weaknesses in their rotation and the Peavy and or Dempster will be at their highest trade value.\nThe rest of the team is in fine shape. The catching remains the same for less money. The infield has 2 gold gloves on the right side and a 30 Home Run hitter at third and very high potential at Short. If  know Middlebrooks had some problems but if you combine the 2012 and 2013 seasons production you have 30 home runs and around 100 RBIs in a season of at bats. Not very many 3rd basemen can say that. Xander has about as much hype as any Sox prospect since Normar. He was solid in the post season and that should help him in 2014. The outfield and bench should be fine with the only question being Jackie Bradley Jr. The two prospects have opposite questions: Bradley is excellent in defense, better than Elsberry with a stronger arm and a middle of the road base stealer. Xander appears to be solid all around with a high BASEBALL IQ and maturity. Remember Pedroia?  Poppi should be ok for another year or two or three. Remember, as a full time DH he had less wear and tear on his body than any position player during the last 10 years which should extend his longevity.\nThe bench should be strong again. Nava has come into his own and ranked in the top 10 in over all hitting last year.Gomes is Gomes and had a very productive year , Carp is a very good hitter and can give Napoli a rest at first and back-up at the corner outfield slots and hit for power. The depth is not as strong as pitching depth but is adequate with the signing of Sizemore.\nThe only questions for 2014 is will Buchhotz finally put a whole season together. If so then the Sox will roll. Other questions are injuries, they took a toll in 2011 and 2012. They started up in 2013 but the depth came through and the team played its best in the Post Season going 11 and 5 with over .688 winning percentage against Baseballs Best. If it wasn't for 2 errors at third in the world series it would have been 11 and 3.\n"}

But the Reds are a far far better team than even the majority of their own fans give them credit for……….why so doubtful ?….From so far away over here in Europe  , my vantage point must be clouded, dull, and incomplete….That might explain why I think that the 2014 playoffs are probable for the Reds and not some misty-eyed longing…….\n"}

Just keep shouting that women are victims because their rights are being horribly abused and that they're getting horribly victimised...\n... for reasons that are trivial, and practically amount to little more than bourgeois whining. Making crusades out of small things and telling a group of people that they're victims and only voting for you can help is exactly what conservatives are trying to expose.\nThe more you fall into their trap, the more successful they will be.\n"}

That is an anti-capitalist myth. Central planning, however, does assume these things. The only assumption the free-market makes is that peaceful, honest people have the right to trade free from coercion, fraud, or violence.\nAlso, the question presumes that the free-market is just another form of central planning. The free-market does not \"create\" any kind of society. In a free-market, society emerges spontaneously from the free, peaceful cooperation of individuals. It is the only economic system that allows individuals to pursue their own personal utopia in their own way, instead of a \"perfect\" world being imposed on everyone be force."}

Voulant juger, par moi-même les raisons de toute cette agitation, je suis donc allé voir ses vidéos ou sur Internet. Bon, j'ai vu… Bien sûr ce n'est pas toujours du meilleur goût, mais pour m'être habitué à la véritable liberté d'expression aux USA l'acharnement à censurer cet homme me répugne et m'inquiète profondément.\nPourquoi, comme vous l'écrivez, ses adversaires ne luttent-ils pas contre Dieudonné avec les armes de l'esprit? Pourquoi pas de contre-sketchs, de caricatures, d'appels au boycott, que sais-je? C'est comme cela que ça se règlerait aux USA; ses adversaires lutteraient férocement contre lui, mais personne ne s'aviserait de le bâillonner! Et s'il l'était la ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) le défendrait! Vive l'Amérique!\nAinsi, parce qu'il ne plaît pas à un groupe qui n'est nullement forcé de l'écouter, il faudrait qu'à TOUS il soit interdit de découvrir par eux-mêmes et pour eux-mêmes ce que sont ses productions? Il faudrait qu'à TOUS il soit interdit d'exercer leur jugement individuel en toute liberté?\nLa censure n'est jamais uniquement la privation de liberté d'expression d'un individu ou d'un groupe. La censure est toujours l'interdiction faite à des milliers ou à des millions de prendre connaissance de certains contenus pour préserver les intérêts de ceux qui ont le pouvoir. Cela est connu depuis l'avènement de la censure.\nOr tout ce qui est \"interdit par  le gouvernement\" se voit conférer un attrait quasi magique pour les spoliés. \n\nDe Jacques Rivette je ne connais et ne possède qu'un titre: \"La Religieuse\"; mes parents et moi avions couru le voir dès que l'interdiction de sa distribution fut levée. J'ai acheté le fim notamment en souvenir de cetet soirée avec mes parents.\n\nA noter (cité de Wikipedia) à propos de la censure de \"La ReligieusE\":\n\"Le 22 mars 1966, la commission de contrôle autorise la distribution du film mais celui-ci doit être interdit aux moins de 18 ans. Une semaine plus tard, Yvon Bourges (secrétaire d'État à l'Information) réunit à nouveau la commission et y convoque le directeur de la sécurité nationale, Maurice Grimaud, afin d'exposer les troubles à l'ordre public que peut provoquer le film. La commission ne change cependant pas son vote, mais son avis n'est que consultatif et le soir du 31 mars 1966, Yvon Bourges interdit la distribution et l'exportation du film.\"\n\n\nLe vieux prétexte menteur et manipulateur des \"TROUBLES À L'ORDRE PUBLIC QUE PEUT PROVOQUER…\" est déjà utilisé. M. Valls, Ministre de l\"intérieur, censure comme le directeur de la sécurité nationale gaulliste.\nQuand on veut tuer son chien on l'accuse de la rage."}

{"comment_id":"content_134215053","time":"20140129224221Z","id":"content_134215053","content":"@cumgranosalis  \nTrès juste.\nVivant aux USA depuis 1973 et ne m'intéressant plus, pour bien des raisons dont l'éloignement, aux humoristes français, il y a 6 mois je n'eus pu dire qui était Dieudonné. Voulant juger, par moi-même les raisons de toute cette agitation, je suis donc allé voir ses vidéos ou sur Internet. Bon, j'ai vu… Bien sûr ce n'est pas toujours du meilleur goût, mais pour m'être habitué à la véritable liberté d'expression aux USA l'acharnement à censurer cet homme me répugne et m'inquiète profondément.\nPourquoi, comme vous l'écrivez, ses adversaires ne luttent-ils pas contre Dieudonné avec les armes de l'esprit? Pourquoi pas de contre-sketchs, de caricatures, d'appels au boycott, que sais-je? C'est comme cela que ça se règlerait aux USA; ses adversaires lutteraient férocement contre lui, mais personne ne s'aviserait de le bâillonner! Et s'il l'était la ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) le défendrait! Vive l'Amérique!\nAinsi, parce qu'il ne plaît pas à un groupe qui n'est nullement forcé de l'écouter, il faudrait qu'à TOUS il soit interdit de découvrir par eux-mêmes et pour eux-mêmes ce que sont ses productions? Il faudrait qu'à TOUS il soit interdit d'exercer leur jugement individuel en toute liberté?\nLa censure n'est jamais uniquement la privation de liberté d'expression d'un individu ou d'un groupe. La censure est toujours l'interdiction faite à des milliers ou à des millions de prendre connaissance de certains contenus pour préserver les intérêts de ceux qui ont le pouvoir. Cela est connu depuis l'avènement de la censure.\nOr tout ce qui est \"interdit par  le gouvernement\" se voit conférer un attrait quasi magique pour les spoliés. \n\nDe Jacques Rivette je ne connais et ne possède qu'un titre: \"La Religieuse\"; mes parents et moi avions couru le voir dès que l'interdiction de sa distribution fut levée. J'ai acheté le fim notamment en souvenir de cetet soirée avec mes parents.\n\nA noter (cité de Wikipedia) à propos de la censure de \"La ReligieusE\":\n\"Le 22 mars 1966, la commission de contrôle autorise la distribution du film mais celui-ci doit être interdit aux moins de 18 ans. Une semaine plus tard, Yvon Bourges (secrétaire d'État à l'Information) réunit à nouveau la commission et y convoque le directeur de la sécurité nationale, Maurice Grimaud, afin d'exposer les troubles à l'ordre public que peut provoquer le film. La commission ne change cependant pas son vote, mais son avis n'est que consultatif et le soir du 31 mars 1966, Yvon Bourges interdit la distribution et l'exportation du film.\"\n\n\nLe vieux prétexte menteur et manipulateur des \"TROUBLES À L'ORDRE PUBLIC QUE PEUT PROVOQUER…\" est déjà utilisé. M. Valls, Ministre de l\"intérieur, censure comme le directeur de la sécurité nationale gaulliste.\nQuand on veut tuer son chien on l'accuse de la rage."}

Teams win SB's not QB's, as evidenced in the Colts/Bears matchup. Manning's play was actually quite mediocre, or similar to Brady's recent playoff performances. Colts won that game because of their ground game and defense. Manning QBR was around 60 and 1-1 TD/INT. I'm shocked it took this long for the media to finally cover the right angle about this game. It really has nothing to do with the temp. It's all about the wind. Based on the recent weather updates it looks as if the Bronco's caught a break. Conditions are as ideal as you could hope for.\n"}

This speaks eloquently so I am sharing the entire thing here:                                            I will be speaking today from the perspective of political science and philosophy to answer the question “What Is Marriage?” I’ve co-authored a book and an article in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy with a classmate of mine from Princeton, Sherif Girgis, and with a professor of ours, Robert George. Justice Samuel Alito cited our book twice in his dissenting opinion in the Supreme Court case involving the Defense of Marriage Act.\nThe title of that book is “What Is Marriage?” An answer to that question is something we didn’t hear today from people on the other side. It’s interesting that we’ve had a three-hour conversation about marriage without much by way of answering that question.\nEveryone in this room is in favor of marriage equality. We all want the law to treat all marriages equally. But the only way we can know whether any state law is treating marriages equally is if we know what a marriage is. Every state law will draw lines between what is a marriage and what isn’t a marriage. If those lines are to be drawn on principle, if those lines are to reflect the truth, we have to know what sort of relationship is marital, as contrasted with other forms of consenting adult relationships.\nSo, in the time I have today, I’ll answer three questions: what is marriage, why does marriage matter for public policy, and what are the consequences of redefining marriage?\nMarriage exists to unite a man and a woman as husband and wife to then be equipped to be mother and father to any children that that union produces. It’s based on the anthropological truth that men and women are distinct and complementary. It’s based on the biological fact that reproduction requires a man and a woman. It’s based on the sociological reality that children deserve a mother and a father.\nWhenever a child is born, a mother will always be close by. That’s a fact of biology. The question for culture and the question for law is whether a father will be close by. And if so, for how long? Marriage is the institution that different cultures and societies across time and place developed to maximize the likelihood that that man would commit to that woman and then the two of them would take responsibility to raise that child.\nPart of this is based on the reality that there’s no such thing as parenting in the abstract: there’s mothering, and there’s fathering. Men and women bring different gifts to the parenting enterprise. Rutgers sociologist Professor David Popenoe writes, “the burden of social science evidence supports the idea that gender-differentiated parenting is important for human development and the contribution of fathers to childrearing is unique and irreplaceable.” He then concludes:\nWe should disavow the notion that mommies can make good daddies, just as we should the popular notion that daddies can make good mommies. The two sexes are different to the core and each is necessary—culturally and biologically—for the optimal development of a human being.\nThis is why so many states continue to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman, many doing so by amending their constitutions.\nSo why does marriage matter for public policy? Perhaps there is no better way to analyze this than by looking to our own president, President Barack Obama. Allow me to quote him:\nWe know the statistics: that children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime, nine times more likely to drop out of school, and twenty times more likely to end up in prison. They are more likely to have behavioral problems or run away from home, or become teenage parents themselves. And the foundations of our community are weaker because of it.\nThere is a host of social science evidence. We go through the litany and cite the studies in our book, but President Obama sums it up pretty well. We’ve seen in the past fifty years, since the war on poverty began, that the family has collapsed. At one point in America, virtually every child was given the gift of a married mother and father. Today, 40 percent of all Americans, 50 percent of Hispanics, and 70 percent of African Americans are born to single moms—and the consequences for those children are quite serious.\nThe state’s interest in marriage is not that it cares about my love life, or your love life, or anyone’s love life just for the sake of romance. The state’s interest in marriage is ensuring that those kids have fathers who are involved in their lives.\nBut when this doesn't happen, social costs run high. As the marriage culture collapses, child poverty rises. Crime rises. Social mobility decreases. And welfare spending—which bankrupts so many states and the federal government—takes off.\nIf you care about social justice and limited government, if you care about freedom and the poor, then you have to care about marriage. All of these ends are better served by having the state define marriage correctly rather than the state trying to pick up the pieces of a broken marriage culture. The state can encourage men and women to commit to each other and take responsibility for their children while leaving other consenting adults free to live and to love as they choose, all without redefining the fundamental institution of marriage.\nOn that note, we’ve heard concerns about hospital visitation rights (which the federal government has already addressed) and with inheritance laws. Every individual has those concerns. I am not married. When I get sick, I need somebody to visit me in the hospital. When I die, I need someone to inherit my wealth. That situation is not unique to a same-sex couple. That is a situation that matters for all of us. So we need not redefine marriage to craft policy that will serve all citizens.\nLastly, I’ll close with three ways in which redefining marriage will undermine the institution of marriage. We hear this question: \"how does redefining marriage hurt you or your marriage?\" I’ll just mention three in the remaining time that I have.\nFirst, it fundamentally reorients the institution of marriage away from the needs of children toward the desires of adults. It no longer makes marriage about ensuring the type of family life that is ideal for kids; it makes it more about adult romance. If one of the biggest social problems we face right now in the United States is absentee dads, how will we insist that fathers are essential when the law redefines marriage to make fathers optional?\nMuch of the testimony we have heard today was special interest pleading from big business claiming that defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman would make it hard for them to appeal to the elite college graduates from the East and the West coasts. We heard no discussion about the common good of the citizens of Indiana—the children who need fathers involved in their lives. Redefining marriage will make it much harder for the law to teach that those fathers are essential.\nSecond, if you redefine marriage, so as to say that the male-female aspect is irrational and arbitrary, what principle for policy and for law will retain the other three historic components of marriage? In the United States, it’s always been a monogamous union, a sexually exclusive union, and a permanent union. We’ve already seen new words created to challenge each and every one of those items.\n\"Throuple\" is a three-person couple. New York Magazine reports about it. Here’s the question: if I were to sue and say that I demand marriage equality for my throuple, what principle would deny marriage equality to the throuple once you say that the male-female aspect of marriage is irrational and arbitrary? The way that we got to monogamy is that it’s one man and one woman who can unite in the type of action that can create new life and who can provide that new life with one mom and one dad. Once you say that the male-female aspect is irrational and arbitrary, you will have no principled reason to retain the number two.\nLikewise, the term \"wedlease\" was introduced in the Washington Post in 2013. A wedlease is a play on the term wedlock. It’s for a temporary marriage. If marriage is primarily about adult romance, and romance can come, and it can go, why should the law presume it to be permanent? Why not issue expressly temporary marriage licenses?\nAnd lastly, the term \"monogamish.\" Monogamish was introduced in the New York Times in 2011. The term suggests we should retain the number two, but that spouses should be free to have sexually open relationships. That it should be two people getting married, but they should be free to have sex outside of that marriage, provided there’s no coercion or deceit.\nNow, whatever you think about group marriage, whatever you think about temporary marriage, whatever you think about sexually open marriage, as far as adults living and loving how they choose, think about the social consequences if that’s the future direction in which marriage redefinition would go. For every additional sexual partner a man has and the shorter-lived those relationships are, the greater the chances that a man creates children with multiple women without commitment either to those women or to those kids. It increases the likelihood of creating fragmented families, and then big government will step in to pick up the pieces with a host of welfare programs that truly drain the economic prospects of all of our states.\nFinally, I’ll mention liberty concerns, religious liberty concerns in particular. After Massachusetts, Illinois, and Washington, DC, either passed a civil union law or redefined marriage, Christian adoption agencies were forced to stop serving some of the neediest children in America: orphans. These agencies said they had no problem with same-sex couples adopting from other agencies, but that they wanted to place the children in their care with a married mom and dad. They had a religious liberty interest, and they had social science evidence that suggests that children do best with a married mom and dad. And yet in all three jurisdictions, they were told they could not do that.\nWe’ve also seen in different jurisdictions instances of photographers, bakers, florists, and innkeepers, people acting in the commercial sphere, saying we don’t want to be coerced. And that’s what redefining marriage would do. Redefining marriage would say that every institution has to treat two people of the same sex as if they’re married, even if those institutions don’t believe that they’re married. So the coercion works in the exact opposite direction of what we have heard.\nEveryone right now is free to live and to love how they want. Two people of the same sex can work for a business that will give them marriage benefits, if the business chooses to. They can go to a liberal house of worship and have a marriage ceremony, if the house of worship chooses to. What is at stake with redefining marriage is whether the law would now coerce others into treating a same-sex relationship as if it’s a marriage, even when doing so violates the conscience and rights of those individuals and those institutions.\nSo, for all of these reasons, this state and all states have an interest in preserving the definition of marriage as the union—permanent and exclusive—of one man and one woman.

Nonetheless, life has taken a turn for me. As of yesterday, I've accepted a principle position with the much anticipated Trim Tab Brewing Company in Birmingham, Alabama - the product of two of my favorite people, dearest friends, and most interesting minds I've had the pleasure of associating with. The opportunity is one for the ages - a career working with folks I love and creating a product that I hold great passion for. The upsides are endless and for that I'm both humbled and excited. The downside is, without much warning or preparation, I'm forced to say goodbye to the town I've called home for nearly a decade, a family and support system I've come to rely on, and quality of life that will be oh so difficult to live without. I hope to see as many of you as I possibly can in my final 11 days....yes, 11 days. But when it's all said and done, I can't really put into words what this opportunity means for me and what this company is destined for. I'm proud - and it feels good to be proud. The only piece left is wrapping my brain around the fact that my Jersey ass is moving to ALABAMA. Birmingham is a great city though, one very much on the rise. So I guess when life gives you lemons? You grab your freakin balls, move to the dirty south, and embrace the life of sweet gravitational nectar. Peace out you's.\n"}

I buy all natural chicken breast put it in a oven safe pan but, I have a tray that I put in the pan that makes all the grease go to the bottom of the pan and not stay on the chicken *I highly suggest everyone get one* \n1. Set oven to 400 \n2. Cut 2 potatoes into round slices and put around the chicken \n3.put green beans and carrots (frozen or fresh but never canned) around the chicken and potatoes \n4.season with sea salt, lemon pepper, and garlic pepper. *I squeeze lemon on mine for extra flavor but it's optional*\n5. Put some organic or natural butter on top I use earth balance it's organic, vegan, gluten and dairy free and made from plants.\nCover with some foil for the first 30 minutes of cooking then uncover and let cook for another 30-45 minutes (time depends on how well the chicken cooks you don't want it bloody or pink breast should be white) \n#eathealthy #noexcuses #fitfam #healthylife #foodporn #chicken #healthyisbeautiful #strongishealthy #thinkfitfood #getfit #fitness\n"}

Its because of a general hatred of the Abbott government. These same people despise the success that Abbott is having in stopping boat loads of financially able people who jump in front of people that I want to give refuge to. Perhaps its because Abbott is just getting on with the job without the controversy of the previous bunch?\n"}

Voulant juger, par moi-même les raisons de toute cette agitation, je suis donc allé voir ses vidéos sur Internet. Bon, j'ai vu… Bien sûr ce n'est pas toujours du meilleur goût, mais pour m'être habitué à la véritable liberté d'expression aux USA l'acharnement à censurer cet homme me répugne et m'inquiète profondément.\nPourquoi, comme vous l'écrivez, ses adversaires ne luttent-ils pas contre Dieudonné avec les armes de l'esprit? Pourquoi pas de contre-sketchs, de caricatures, d'appels au boycott, que sais-je? C'est comme cela que ça se règlerait aux USA; ses adversaires lutteraient férocement contre lui, mais personne ne s'aviserait de le bâillonner! Et s'il l'était la ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) le défendrait! Vive l'Amérique!\nAinsi, parce qu'il ne plaît pas à un groupe qui n'est nullement forcé de l'écouter, il faudrait qu'à TOUS il soit interdit de découvrir par eux-mêmes et pour eux-mêmes ce que sont ses productions? Il faudrait qu'à TOUS il soit interdit d'exercer leur jugement individuel en toute liberté?\nLa censure n'est jamais uniquement la privation de liberté d'expression d'un individu ou d'un groupe. La censure est toujours l'interdiction faite à des milliers ou à des millions de prendre connaissance de certains contenus pour préserver les intérêts de ceux qui ont le pouvoir. Cela est connu depuis l'avènement de la censure.\nOr tout ce qui est \"interdit par  le gouvernement\" se voit conférer un attrait quasi magique pour les spoliés. \n\nDe Jacques Rivette je ne connais et ne possède qu'un titre: \"La Religieuse\"; mes parents et moi avions couru le voir dès que l'interdiction de sa distribution fut levée. J'ai acheté le fim notamment en souvenir de cetet soirée avec mes parents.\n\nA noter (cité de Wikipedia) à propos de la censure de \"La ReligieusE\":\n\"Le 22 mars 1966, la commission de contrôle autorise la distribution du film mais celui-ci doit être interdit aux moins de 18 ans. Une semaine plus tard, Yvon Bourges (secrétaire d'État à l'Information) réunit à nouveau la commission et y convoque le directeur de la sécurité nationale, Maurice Grimaud, afin d'exposer les troubles à l'ordre public que peut provoquer le film. La commission ne change cependant pas son vote, mais son avis n'est que consultatif et le soir du 31 mars 1966, Yvon Bourges interdit la distribution et l'exportation du film.\"\n\n\nLe vieux prétexte menteur et manipulateur des \"TROUBLES À L'ORDRE PUBLIC QUE PEUT PROVOQUER…\" est déjà utilisé. M. Valls, Ministre de l\"intérieur, censure comme le directeur de la sécurité nationale gaulliste.\nQuand on veut tuer son chien on l'accuse de la rage."}

{"comment_id":"content_134217080","time":"20140129224942Z","id":"content_134217080","content":"Supply & Demand.  There are probably at least 10 high school kids that *could* play college football for every scholarship offered.  Thus, supply is huge.  Demand is limited to the number of scholarships, which stays relatively constant.  Want to get paid to play football?  Wait and tryout for the NFL, CFL, etc.\nWorth? \nThe cost of a college education continues to go up and many scholarships are wasted on kids who can't read past a 4th grade level. (See UNC studies).  That is reward enough.\nI had 40 hours of class (architecture) my first two years and I never worked less than 35 hrs/ week to pay my way through school.  No one provided tuition, room & board, books, clothing, tutors, etc. for me.\n"}

Very little of that debt was due to additional spending programs by Obama; the stimulus was less than $1 trillion. More people qualified for safety net programs, and it would have been foolish to cut those off both because of the adverse effect on those individuals and on the economy. And much of the debt was caused by lower revenues due to the fiscal collapse.\n\nAll in all, the stimulus basically offset cutbacks at the state level but didn't do much more than that. And Republicans insisted on cutting discretionary spending. So there has been austerity, despite the increase in debt.\n"}

That was S. 3364 (112th Congress): Bring Jobs Home Act, BTW. It failed cloture--i.e. was blocked by the Republicans. Happily, the bill was reintroduced as https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr851 with Prognosis: 1% chance of getting past committee,  0% chance of being enacted. But this is occurring in the House where Only 11% of bills made it past committee and only about 3% were enacted in 2011–2013. Now that's productivity as Republicans define productivity?!?!?!"}

If Kenya kept her opinions to herself, none of us would probably be watching this show or posting on this blog. Secondly, everyone on that show states their opinions. Nene is famous for her talking head commentary. So why should Kenya be the only person not allowed to have an opinion and state it without having to worry about getting jumped on? \nIn my experience, people who want to fight when they hear something they don't like are  either reacting badly to the truth and/or are lousy at battling verbally so they resort to violence. \n\nThree, Brendon is not always around when Kenya gets into verbal spats so it is stretch to say she is endangering him. Also let's not forget that Brandon intervened to stop Christopher from manhandling Kenya. So if there was going to be a fight it should have been between Christopher and Brandon. Peter got up and violently shoved Brandon away. It wasn't like Brandon had jumped on Christopher. It did not warrant all that. That's when Apollo jumped in. Too bad he is not smart enough to know that if you intervene in a fight, you might get hit.  Apollo appeared to be already seething about something and spoiling for a fight. Recall that even after the fight was over, at the end of the show he was headed back towards Brandon like he was going to jump on him again.  Note how gruff he was with Phaedra at the child's christening part. Not that I blame him for that. It was some seriously embarrassingly over-the-top mess. I bet Phaedra had to make him come. Not saying he did not want to attend a celebration for his son but it did not have to be with all that pomp and circumstance which he knew would be shown on national TV and make him look foolish too.\n"}

You know I just think they hadn't see the talent that I had, they thought I was a zero, I could stay there and embiter but I just practised and practised. If no one believes in you anithing you do is positive. It wasn't about basketball it was proving them all that they were wrong: there is a reason because i play with number 0\" G.A.\nSTAY STRONG, ALWAYS!\n"}

However, anyone who has found himself in a threatening situation can attest that such a confrontation can easily escalate into violence, even if it's not to the \"I'm going to kill you\" degree that a loudmouth claims it will be. While it is almost certain that Grimm wouldn't have actually thrown him off the balcony, but it's just as certain that he was angry enough to commit some form of violence, even if it was just a punch, and there was no call for even a verbal threat of violence.\n"}

{"comment_id":"content_134218594","time":"20140129225520Z","id":"content_134218594","content":"Eigenvector Matt As noted below, things vary from institution to institution, but virtually anywhere in the American system, failing to get tenure is the academic equivalent of the death penalty. You get (at most) one grace year to look for other jobs, which you do with the stink of failure on you, which almost certainly prevents you from getting another tenure-track position.\n\nThat's more job security than a lot of people have, of course, but remember that getting a Ph.D. in many fields means skipping 6-8 years of income, with the understanding that you'll take the first job you get, no matter where or in what circumstances. So failing to get tenure means, for most people, a massive reversal of personal fortune. In many fields, it means (at best) that you'll be unemployed for a year while you wait for a much less desirable post, probably in a different part of the country. If you have a spouse or children that aren't perfectly happy to pull up stakes and follow your dwindling fortunes, it's game over for you as a scholar--and, therefore, your entire life's work up to that point.\n\nI should have known as soon as I saw that magnitude of error that it was a Hanna Rosin byline. It's a big enough mistake that the story would have been totally different if she'd understood what she (mistakenly) believed: absolutely the difference between \"Obama re-elected with smaller margin\" and \"Romney defeats Obama.\" But of course, they just changed the one line. So never having known much about Melissa Harris-Perry, I now know absolutely nothing, thanks to this kind of crack reporting.\n"}

Forget she is a refugee for a moment and just let the statement sink in. \nBut what worries me the most about the lack of police investigation into these matters is that these men who are allegedly perpetrating this disgusting crime might be (some day) allowed in our country. Would you want your wife, daughter, sister, mother, aunt or female friend in a position where she can possibly be raped as well?"}

Took Max (my dog) to the vet yesterday. That's twice in one month! He is now on antibiotics (for his itching - he has an allergy to something) and steroids to help with his arthritus. The interesting fact is that this all happened almost to the day 3 years ago. Vet was wondering if there was a particular grass seed at this time of the year that affects poor Max. Has anyone else experienced similiar problems with their dogs? The good news is that after only 24 hours Max seems so much better.\n"}

And, batting Hamilton 8th maximizes the effect of the pitcher sacrificing, i.e., Hamilton is likely to get to second on his own and move to third on the sacrifice. Thus, Votto is likely to have as many chances to drive in Hamilton and there is less initial stress on Hamilton.\n"}

Name dropping great fighters like Manny and Floyd is as close as Mundine will ever get to them and that is his just deserts. How demoralising for him to spruik the names of champions he purports to have on his list and then he jumps in the ring with a fighter that does not even cause a ripple on the richter scale. He wants Australia to get behind him but its all too little too late.  It is amazing that there were very few that even knew there was a fight on. Main reason for that is that Mundine was one of the fighters!! . For the reputation of the sport and its many champions, he should bow out now.\n"}

{"comment_id":"content_1e389388bed3a780e066f9040668776a","time":"20140129225611Z","id":"content_1e389388bed3a780e066f9040668776a","content":"Here is something to think about....as many debate what we can do to prevent violent crimes. Any of us that see the news & see the constant violence & senseless unexplainable wrong doings of shootings, & the aftermath of victims, survivors, & their families dealing with all this,  from the evil of these actions. People that act out like in Virginia Tech, the Aurora, CO movie shooting, the Sandy Hook school killings,& other school shootings,  the recent Maryland mall shooting, & the Tampa movie killing, & many more, are sick people. I read an interesting article of a specialist & researcher, psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey, MD who is the founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center, which is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting timely & effective treatment of the mentally ill. He says that many of these tragedies are predictable. He says that the chances that the a perpetrator of a mass shooting displayed signs of mental illness prior to the crime are one in two. He says conservatively estimates that 10% of US homicides(based on an analysis of studies) are committed by untreated severely mentally ill. (Many violent acts are also perpetrated by sane people too.) This article points out that as states & counties pare back, there are few mental-health services. In the 1950's more than a half million people lived in US mental institutions- 1 in 300 Americans. By the late 1970's, only 160,000 did, by the efforts to deinstitutionalize the mentally ill. Today there is one public psychiatric-care bed per 7,100 Americans- the same ratio as in 1850. Emptying asylums saved money, & with anti-psychotic drugs, hospitals were thought to not be needed. Deinstitutionalization restored citizens' rights & protected them from deplorable conditions..so wouldn't it be better for the mentally ill to be treated at home, with support therapy & medication vs clinics? Then in 1961, a joint of the American Medical & American Psychiatric Associations recommended integrating the mentally ill into society--depending on local facilities where mentally ill patients could receive outpatient care. Congress passed a law for funding these community mental health centers. In 1963, states downsized their psychiatric hospitals faster than expected. Then adequate funding for these services NEVER CAME THROUGH...because of the lack of political will, the Vietnam War & the economic crisis. Then in 1980, the Mental Health System Act was passed. Then a year later Ronald Reagan gutted the act,decreased mental health spending by 30% & shifted the burden to state & local gov'ts. The crucial services the mentally ill were supposed to receive failed to materialize, & the result was that more & more people ended up on the streets. Since 2009, states have cut $4.35 billion collectively in public mental health spending. As of 2006, 1.3 million of America's mentally ill were housed in prisons. Between 1998 & 2006, the number of mentally ill people in prison has QUADRUPLED. In some county jails, rates of inmates with mental illness has increased by nearly 50% in the past 5 years.Individual jails report that 25 to 30% of their inmates are mentally ill. The author of this article, states that the pendulum has swung far past patients rights & well into the territory of WILD NEGLECT. \"The dismantling of the mental health system has left those willing to undergo treatment with no options & rendered ineffective the laws intended to protect against dangerous scenarios.\" \"You either have to be trying to kill your psychiatrist or trying to kill yourself in front of the psychiatrist to receive assistance. \"We ignore the mentally ill until they commit a crime that lands them in prison.\" A public defender stated,\" Over & over again, we see situations where parents of those who commit these offenses...say they've been trying & trying to get treatment for their kids, & it's just NOT available. And it is usually young adults. There's not enough out there in terms of resources for families.\" The cost of treatment is not easy either. \"how do you put the price on people losing their lives when someone has a psychotic break?\"........Later... I had watched Anderson Cooper's CNN interview concerning all this with the Virginia Senator, who was stabbed from his son. & then his son committed suicide by shooting himself....No beds were apparently available....Then there were...He knew his son needed help....but he couldn't have him committed because of his age, & his son would not get help...& then it was too late. There is a lot of issues surrounding the heartbreak of unnecessary acts & deaths.....This all opened my eyes to the underlying issues at hand..whether it be gun control or mental health...This opened my eyes to understanding the history of getting help to many that need it....before it is too late. Something to really think about.\n"}

Let the other 3 major sports set up their own minor league systems like MLB and then those that so choose can make a choice of sticking to sports or getting a scholarship to attend College. Most College fans are fans of the team, not necessarily the individuals, so they'll still watch. It would take quite a bit of the hypocrisy out of the system imo, not that the NFL, NBA, or NHL would probably ever agree to it.\n"}

They want you to settle.  I.e. it's ok to own subpar devices and have a relatively subpar experience.  \n\nAs far as people's needs go, we are very resilient and are able to quickly adapt to changes/environments.. so yes, the saying \"if you build it they will come\" is true.. even if what we build isn't all that great.  But as people we owe it to ourselves to want and desire the best. To always strive to be better, smarter, more efficient.  And looking at the industry over the last 20yrs, that original desire to be and have the best isn't there.  These days people are ok with just being OK.  i3 is just ok.  It's not great. Yes you can justify using it as your daily processor.  You can also justify using a calculator or not using a computer at all.  This isn't an argument about what's better or worse, but an argument of going after the best.   This is my personal opinion of course. Everyone's different.  I just remember the days when majority wanted the best.  Right now, this isn't the case and it's sad (to me).\n"}

First, they make it seem like the 90 days is to decide if you want to get married. WRONG! If the USCIS even thinks you are still considering, NO VISA! The point is you are already suppose to know without question by the time you even apply for the visa and the visa takes 6 or 7 months. Next I want to point out, how on earth did they find these couples? Seriously, Russ, you are going to bring your fiancee here from another country and have to stay at mom and dad's did you think that would work? Mike, stop putting your Fiancee in bad awkward situations, SHE DOESN'T LIKE EATING IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE, stop! Louys, ex-wife or Fiancee? Can't have both my friend, you have to decide quickly. No woman, I don't care from what country is going to put up with the ex still running your life..  Alan, communicate your fears to your future wife, but support her endeavors, without something to do, something to work toward or it looks like she may return to home and mom. The K-1 visa can be wonderful, it has been a dream come true for me and I think my wife would say the same thing. However America isn't better, it's just different and can present more opportunities than many places in the world. You can't expect a young woman (or man) to come here and be charmed by the American dream, you still have to build your relationship and life together, just like you are going to marry someone local. Thanks for your time, I enjoyed the article..\n"}

{"comment_id":"content_134219734","time":"20140129225934Z","id":"content_134219734","content":"I usually love Upworthy, but this article bothers me. At the 2 Texas high schools I attended (Tivy & Clark), we learned about evolution in Biology (from a teacher who was Christian) & basic beliefs of various religions in World History (from a teacher who was atheist). In my opinion, that's how it should be, unbiased, in order to have a respect & understanding for others' beliefs as well as for further development of our own. While I agree everyone in a public school should be presented with evolution, it is important to remember that it is not called the \"law,\" but the \"theory\" of evolution, & some religions view it as such. I keep seeing arguments in the comments here between creationists and those who believe in evolution. I'm not here to discuss the validity of evolution, & I think many of you are missing the point. Because it is a public school, everyone's beliefs should be represented & respected rather than forcing any one belief on anyone. After all, that's true equality, is it not? Furthermore, teaching evolution in public schools is the law, so perhaps it's the under-represented religions who have something to be upset about. Tax dollars go to a lot of things we don't all agree with, but I'll refrain from listing all of those. If you're that bothered by religion being taught in public schools, do what creationists do, & open a private school of evolution & apply for state funding for it.\n"}

{"comment_id":"content_134219748","time":"20140129225936Z","id":"content_134219748","content":"The biggest challenge Indonesia will face in implementing any kind of significantly improve mass transit system, and in particular one as expensive as high-speed rail, is to make it cost-effective. Whether the national government of Indonesia takes a controlling interest, or a private company such as Hitachi wins a contract to supply, install, maintain and operate, the pictures in the article give an indication of the significant issues faced in making the system pay its way: many commuters in urban areas are paying little or no fare for their ride at present: this must change if high-speed rail is introduced. \nAdditionally, infrastructure investment will be required to adequately restrict access to tracks and hence allow high-speed trains to run safely and efficiently. These are significant hurdles.\nHere in Australia, where citizens enjoy significantly greater income than our friends in Indonesia, we have had a running public commentary for many years about the advantages of high-speed rail. However, even with a link between Sydney and Melbourne (which is presently the 5th busiest air corridor in the world) making such a link commercially viable is a challenge that has - thus far - prevented any serious attempts by governments to explore high-speed rail.\nThe final challenge is one perhaps that both Indonesia and Australia share: either country would need a Government in power that has a compelling vision for the future, and the political braveness and will-power to see it through....something that is certainly lacking in Australia at present.\n"}

I lived in Glendale years ago and used to go down to the river to walk around the more natural areas by the equestrian center. Now I live in Gardena just south of Glendale and have discovered the Gardena Willows Wetlands. During the rainy season this area was a tributary to the southern part of the LA River. Having experienced both places gave me a sense of how special the LA basin was and why the native people, the Spanish and then everyone else wanted to live here. Sadly we have lost the natural elements that were here. Organizations like the Friends of Gardena Willows are working to bring it back. Check them out, they have a cool video that tells the Willows story.\nRB.\n"}

Utility companies are facing big time losses. If the price of electricity hits rock bottom (spot or wholesale) due to preferential access for clean power, they got to ramp up or down their conventional plants .. this is causing huge losses . infact this is causing an increase in the generation, production and distribution costs .At times, the spot prices are negative...! Can any one believe this... How can some one sell at -ve price...? it means they got to get rid of it at any cost....They cannot pass this on to customers as there is no profit made in the first place. infact, this is the reason why end customers are paying too much.. not the EEG surcharge.. its just 13 %, the major cost for end customer is 56% production and distribution costs...\n\nA simple solution is this excellent proposal of the post... generate methane, when excess power, feed it into existing gas grid...\n"}

One professor has been indicted on fraud charges for being paid for a class he didn't teach.\nThe university has always maintained it was an isolated case, but Folt is now acknowledging a broader problem.\n\"We also accept the fact that there was a failure in academic oversight for years that permitted this to continue,\" Folt told UNC trustees last week.\n\"This, too, was wrong. And it has undermined our integrity and our reputation.\"\n"}

Tyler does bring in energy which is good to see and he can offer more athleticism. But Berman trying to suggest it was Bargnani's fault for losing all those games is ridiculous.  Bags is often made to play too far out of the paint to give Melo more room.  Which is fine, but then people complain about him not grabbing rebounds or scoring in the paint.  Hard to do when every set play has him behind the three point line.  He started driving more and playing more aggressive only to have Berman say he clumsily fell driving to the basket when he got hurt.  Not undercut, as it really happened.  I like the way he casually mentions Bags is the second leading scorer however chooses to point him out instead of the other players that struggled badly during loses. I do hope Tyler and others playing well keep getting quality minutes.  Which will be hard to do with Woodson's history.\n"}

Firstly, if moto lose less money, break even or even make a profit then there is no offset tax loss and also a smaller dismantled company is bound to make fewer losses. The calculations assume a maximum exposure for the purposes of their calculations and estimate a 700m benefit in the US per annum and a 700m overseas benefit per annum. Even with these best possible scenario figures the total benefit would not have been realised until 2019 - we are less than half way to that point since moto was acquired and there is no factual evidence to back up any figures currently. I would say this is a very good move for google, who are clearly cutting their losses. They gambled during the scramble for patents acquisitions and have not successfully asserted a single Motorola Patent. Many analysts rightly pointed out that it was likely a mistake. Google almost certainly made losses, even with the wildly optimistic estimates of tax breaks - they can't possibly have realised anywhere near the amount of money required to make a 1.5bn loss, never mind a 1.5bn profit. so please Simmer down (or at least provide some factual evidence to back up your ridiculous claims).\n"}

Your value of Callahan is obviously much different than mine and with the trade deadline coming up soon i would rather trade and get someone in return instead of losing him in the offseason for nothing.

It's absolutely how Deathwing was able to summon Ragnaros to Hyjal - the Firelands were breaching Azeroth in the area already.

We all know the president stance on women's\nproductive rights and his position on guns. There is only so much one can fit\ninto a 2hrs speech, even Obama, who is perhaps the best orator of presidents\nsince I seriously started paying attention to politics. It's widely said that\nReagan was a good orator, but so was Bill Clinton and now Barrack Obama. And\nfrankly, of the three, Obama is the best. I have never seen anyone in my life's\ntime presently that has been able to read a teleprompter as good as he (Obama)\ndoes - Wolf Blitzer of CNN also alluded to this. Anyway, for the rest of\nReagan's term, I was in the military, despite that, I was still able to catch\nseveral of his speeches. Obama speech overall was good, he covered off many things,\nthough his primary focus was on the economy (jobs, raising the minimum wage,\nand women getting their due respect for doing equally the same job as a man).\nThe Republican rebuttal came from Cathy Rodgers I thought was flat, no\nspecifics, weak and substance, biographical and visionary. We only hope that\nthe republicans in days and months to come, set aside their hatred, nuances,\nhow many laws to appeal - per John Boehner's statement, their sole purpose in\ncongress, put the clown Tea Bagger members in the Senate and Congress on notice,\nand start working in a Bipartisan effort for the goodness of the USA and all\nAmericans.\n"}

Utility companies are facing big time losses. If the price of electricity hits rock bottom (spot or wholesale) due to preferential access for clean power, they got to ramp up or down their conventional plants .. this is causing huge losses . infact this is causing an increase in the generation, production and distribution costs .At times, the spot prices are negative...! Can any one believe this... How can some one sell at -ve price...? it means they got to get rid of it at any cost....They cannot pass this on to customers as there is no profit made in the first place. infact, this is the reason why end customers are paying too much.. not the EEG surcharge.. its just 13 %, the major cost for end customer is 56% production and distribution costs...\n\nA simple solution is this excellent proposal of the post... generate methane, when excess power, feed it into existing gas grid...\n\nAlso recent news reports indicate huge losses made by RWE and EnBw...they are crying like babies...don't know what to do... they gotta change their business models sooner or later..."}

This is something like I have never seen before. In the mean time why don't you stop weeny whining about how afraid you are of aluminum all over these posts and start sending some emails to GM. Convince them to get going where you already know they need to go. I'd hate to think they have not already begun working on an aluminum next gen truck but they do still use pushrods. Hell their next truck may be cast iron."}

Sorry but it won't. Nintendo could easily have released a console comparable in hardware to Sony and MS but the didn't. Also they rehash and have been living off the same games for years. Call of duty doesn't get a pass on that so why does Nintendo.\nTheir product is stale and it is showing. They'll continue to have losses unless they get with the program. Invite 3rd party devas, invent a new IP, and cut the price of the Wii u by 100$.\n"}

There were 33 couples married at the Grammys - only some of which were same sex. In the post -- which has since been deleted from his Facebook but saved in a screen grab by The Wrap -- Cameron wrote, in part:\n\"How did you like the Grammy's all out assault on the traditional family? As a husband and father, I am proud to announce the release of my new family movie, MERCY RULE. Last night, the lines were drawn thick and dark. Now more than ever, we must work together to create the world we want for our children. I'm hoping that just as Fireproof restored marriages, MERCY RULE will strengthen families.\" \nAs Bugs Bunny used to say, \"What a Maroon.\"\n"}

Having a non-commercial media player is important. However in saying that - said non-commercial media has a duty to present news, news commentary and documentaries in as un-biased manner as possible. They also have a duty to ensure the content is factually correct as a matter of course. That is journalism at its professional best.  And what we want from the tax payer funded ABC is journalism at its professional best -- and nothing less. A recent letter to the editor proposed that every ABC news programme, ABC news commentary programmes and ABC documentaries should as a matter of course finish off with credits as to who the producer and director was for it.  That would go a long way in ensuring that the ABC tightens up its processes and its personnel are accountable.\n"}

And when you look ahead to 2024 - after two Hillary terms, the Democrats would have won every popular vote but one (W beat Kerry by 3 million votes in 2004) and controlled the Oval Office for the last 40 years (since 1984) Add that to changing demographics in big states like Tejas and you see why the Grand OLD Party should be scared to death about any increase of Executive Power."}

The question then becomes, \"Can the Seahawks D create enough pressure to get Manning off his game and to make mistakes?\" I'm afraid the answer is going to be NO. The Seahawks are going to have a tough time trying to predict his snap count, and if he makes heavy use of the Omaha audible, its going to be damn near impossible.\nBest thing Seattle can do is come out of the gate with Blitzes. Blitz early and often. Even if you don't get to him, you got to try to shake him out of his comfort zone. Blunt his receivers at the LOS, force them off their routes and try to get Manning to make bad throws(I know, I know, next to improbable). Who knows? A couple of those can turn into INT's quite easily. \nIf Wilson gets into a shootout with Manning, this game will be over. Time of Possession and Turnovers WILL be the key to this one.\n"}

The latest Weatherill self promoting ad wherein he lists the achievements of this government.. As pointed out in the article, none of the projects are paid for and will incur ongoing debt for decades to come. Even just paying the interest on these projects will keep us in debt. Weatherill has been an abysmal failure. The latest tv ad shows him for what he is, a union puppeteer denigrating Abbott without foundation. This Labor government has taken the last 12 years as an indication it is a law unto itself and above accountability and transparency. Weatherill failed as Education Minister and continues to fail as Premier. The fact that he refused to take disciplinary action against advisers who failed to advise him of sexual abuse against a school student says a lot about the character of the man. The lack of action by those advisers was indefensible. Weatherill has failed to bring strong leadership and continues with the rhetoric of a union hack. His continued attack against Abbott on the Holdens issued highlighted his failure to pick up on the messages coming out of GM that it was a decision made in America to pull the plug on Holdens, but that did not suit Weatherill's agenda.\n"}

Wallker played for UK for two years, won the NCAA Championship in 96′ and then entered the NBA Draft. There, he made over $110M throughout his career. Sadly, it’s all gone.\nThe southtownstar reported that Walker was presented with a $2.3 million foreclosure lawsuit on his mother’s mansion. This seemed to get the bankruptcy ball rolling. Here’s an excerpt from the article.\n[QUOTE]In the bankruptcy filing, the former basketball star – who reportedly earned $110 million in his 13-year career – lists his liabilities as $12.7 million against $4.2 million in assets, which include a $20,000 watch and a $6,000 Miami Heat NBA championship ring.\nWalker, 33, bought the $2.3 million, 13,000-square-foot home, complete with 11 bathrooms, on Athena Court for his mother in June 2005, according to court records.\nNow, five years later, Walker owes almost $70,000 in back property taxes on the home, according to public records.\nAdd to that the $1.2 million in gambling debt he owes to casinos in East Chicago, Ind., and in Las Vegas and the $750,000 he owes to the Clark County district attorney’s office in Las Vegas.\nIn 2009, Walker was charged with writing $1 million worth of bad checks at casinos in Las Vegas. He cut a deal with prosecutors to pay the money back but still owes them the majority of the cash.\nOn top of that, Walker said in his bankruptcy filing that he owes former agent Mark Bartelstein almost $500,000.\n"}

I do not believe or wish that any of these 3 things is true. Therefore, I do not wish that any prospect will crack the rotation. \nNow, do I hope some would achieve MLB performance level? Sure, but I'm also totally invested in the Dodgers \"win now\" philosophy. And that calls for Dodgers having the pieces to win right now, and presumably into the future, where high priced vets (not named Kershaw etc.) would naturally (in a way that doesn't involve Dodgers crapping out) give way to the economical, brightest up-and-coming from the farm.\n"}

Spoken like a true stoner.\nLet's put it this way - when you burn something and intentionally inhale the smoke IT HURTS YOUR LUNGS. And when something gives a strong euphoric reaction which you build a tolerance to IT'S ADDICTIVE. I've smoked occasionally in the past and I've spoken to people who smoke regularly who confirm that it's addictive. Then again, I've also spoken to stoners who say it magically cures cancer. Because it's green and green means it's natural and anything natural cures cancer.\nYou know what else is green (sometimes) and natural? Manure. Go smoke somma that."}

It would have been a tall order if he had won there and then try to win his 9th French Open. No one in this era has won the first two slams. And for Rafa to do it may be asking for too much.\n\"Jump the shark\" experience has happen more than once to a great player. When Rafa had three break chances to get back on even terms,  I just knew he was going to do it. But it didn't happened. Stan served with an ace and won the first set. Rafa must have felt like a fish out of water. How was this happening? This guy has never beaten Rafa, not even won a set, but now he has won the first set of a GS. One of the biggest tournament that means so much to Rafa. No wonder Rafa couldn't adjust to play as he usual does, he never have played against Stan when he has lost a set. He was always ahead in their matches.\nIt's understandable how Rafa lost. There were no time to adjust to playing a guy who he never have lost a set to before. It was new to him, and he could not adjust. \nIf Rafa had won the first set, Rafa may have won the match. Winning first is what Rafa is accustom to, especially when playing against Stan.\n"}

Google got what they wanted, peace with patent trolls, at least for a while, and most importantly, it got to keep the R&D department which Motorola always prized on.\n\nBrand itself is fairly washed out for few years now and lost the battle of the mobile industry to large giants like Samsung and it was only natural to go under the umbrella of another giant that is struggling to make a breakthrough in western mobile market.\nWas it a bad deal? Maybe yes, maybe no.\nDid Google lose money ? Hell yeah, but on the other hand they got bucket load of patents, which aren't worth that much, but at least they saved themselves court troubles.\n"}

Also, if one fisherman is ripping us off to the tune of nearly $6000 per day, what were they going to cost if all the others the government wanted 'on the job' going to cost? If Fisheries can do it now when no fisherman will, why weren't they given the job in the first place to save the taxpayers some money?

(TX)\nAssess student performance in 4th, 8th, and 12th grades\nReal improvement in our schools is not simply a matter of spending more:\n It's a matter of asking more--expecting more--of our schools, our \nteachers, of our kids, of our parents, and ourselves. And that's why \ntonight I am announcing America's education\ngoals:By the year 2000, every child must start school ready to learn.The US must increase the high school graduation rate to no less than 90%.And we are going to make sure our schools' diplomas mean something. In critical subjects--at the\n4th, 8th, and 12th grades--we must assess our students' performance.By the year 2000, US students must be first in the world in math and science achievement.Every American adult must be a skilled, literate worker and citizen.\nEvery school must offer the kind of disciplined environment that makes it possible for our kids to learn..Ambitious aims? Of course. Easy to do? Far from it. But the future's at stake.\nSource: http://www.ontheissues.org/SOTU_Bush.htm\n, Jan 31, 1990\n"}

Oh yes we do. A lot of them! We probably go through 3 or 4 bunches a week? Why? Because they are a superfood, a powerhouse of nutrition and do awesome things for your body. So many people avoid eating bananas because they are a calorie dense fruit. But the benefits far outweighs the calorie and carb count con.\nBananas help you reach your weight-loss goals, keep your bowels healthy, provide nutrients that regulate heart rhythm and have vitamin compounds for eye health. \nIt is also one of the ideal foods to be eaten immediately after a strenuous workout. The simple sugars present in them quickly provide energy and normalize the blood sugar levels.\nSo, I vote you start eating a banana everyday. Don't be afraid of the calories and carbs- no one ever got fat by eating bananas.\n"}

And since then, they have succeeded in that. But part of the tactic is to put the obstructionist albatross around Obama's neck at the same time. They have accused him of acting outside the constitution, of being aloof, reclusive and stubborn. But the reality is, the administration and the Dems have simply refused to give into the blackmail that the minority has tried to foist off as mainstream. This is the narrative the Republicans so desperately want to portray: that Washington gridlock and a do-nothing Congress is the fault of this President. Fact is, Obama is long overdue to stage a landing behind enemy lines. He has done no more in the way of executive orders than had his predecessors and much less than previous Presidents, including Reagan. Guy needs to man up, call them out for what they are and take the heat. We need more jobs. We need immigration addressed. We need the minimum wage lifted. And we need to make Obamacare work (it can and it will). Get after it, Barack.\n"}

What boggles my mind, is that there are clearly a number of people here that have an agenda, in which they're using this case and holding up three people who are involved in something that is absolutely horrible and disgusting, to further their agenda. And they're doing this at the expense of two (by all accounts) wonderful women, and their friends and families. Why? Why use THIS CASE to talk about your problem with Americans losing their rights? Certainly you could pick a better case, where the people who are supposedly having their rights trampled, aren't complete ***holes.

In my last semester of college and I get to teach all day and do what I love, plus some other good things stirring up and I'm so excited. \nOne thing I learned is that not everyone will understand your God given purpose. So don't get discouraged when you don't have people rooting you on and questioning your reasons behind your actions. If you are doing something and it's your passion and God is guiding your footsteps, don't let no one try to steal your joy or get in the way of your what you are doing. Sometimes you just might be your own cheerleader. \nAnd remember, things don't happen overnight, it takes hard work, dedication and consistency. There may be obstacles, but that is not a reason to get discouraged and quit.\nSet some goals, get up and make things happen. \nXoxo, \nVic\n"}

Congrats on keeping the stains off of it.\nYour problem is this. You can't accept the truth about how they inflate quarterback statistics so they can sell jerseys and posters (and, of course that bobble head doll you have in the back of your car). No other sport would even think of using a method like that for creating statistics.\nWhen a guy hits a home run, do they measure the distance the pitcher threw the ball in order for the guy to hit it? Hell no.\nIn hockey, does the guy get credit for the length of the ice he skated when he flips a puck into the net from 3 feet? Hell no.\nIn basketball, does the guy get credit for how far he dribbled down the court when he shoots a 15 footer? Hell no.\nBut in the NFL, I can throw a 1/2 yard pass and get 100 yards of credit if the receiver can run that far after the catch. Go figure. \nIt's designed this way on purpose for the benefit of marketing since the NFL knows, without a doubt, what positions are their marquee bread and butter money makers. \nThe big difference between Manning and any other quarterback is that Manning is lucky his receivers run for lots and lots of yards after the catch which add to his total. If they caught the passes and fell down or were tackled immediately then his stats would be total crap. His 'glory' comes from their efforts, not his. Deal with it.\n"}

Westerns actually worked to challenge and elevate the black and white morality of the child mind but sadly the storyline and themes could always be reduced to simple good and evil with good always winning because of the Hays Code.\n\nPeople object when the apparent bad guy goes free or wins because the system is flawed or a greater crime...or public harm..... would be required to punish them.\n\nThat is what makes capital punishment so harmful.  Murder by one is wrong but murder by many is a social horror.\n"}

The point I am trying to make is that although there is a risk of injurie for pitchers from hit balls, it's only small. If MLB would make a true probabillistic analysis of all risks involved, this one would not even be close to the top. The only way to truly protect baseball players from getting injured by the ball is have them all wear legguards, chestprotectors, helmets and masks, like catchers already do. And catchers still end up with concussions. Part of any sport athe highest levels is to be brave enough to accept the health risks involved. Surely I do not want anybody to get injured, but for me fear for the ball is part of the game and taking that fear away takes away from the game. I myself was a player  at a decent level once who hit up the middle a lot and that messed with the pitcher's mind. On the other side I have had pitchers show me chin music and follow that up with breaking pitches that started out at my shoulder which made me buckle and miss.\nThe thing that makes this such a hot topic is that we are so aware of the risks in baseball as we see it all happen on TV and even in replay/slomotion. I was just as much apalled as anybody at seeing A.J.; Happ get hit in the head last year, but the new cap would not have done a whole lot for him as he was hit on the site of the head below the cap.\n"}

Najat Valaud Belkacem est allée promouvoir le mariage gay dans les collèges au moment où la France était divisée. Le SNUipp, principal syndicat du primaire, a publié une feuille de route pour les enseignants, \"Éduquer contre l’homophobie dès l’école primaire\", que l'on peut consulter sur internet. On y appelle à \"déconstruire la complémentarité des sexes pour transformer en profondeur la société\". L'idée est de montrer aux enfants le plus tôt possible, dès l'école maternelle, que la norme n'est pas une famille composée d'un homme, une femme et des enfants. Avec des livres comme \"Jean a deux mamans\" et \"papa porte une robe\", car \"un livre pour enfant, c'est un peu une petite graine qu'on sème. A cet âge là, l'orientation sexuelle des enfants n'est sans doute pas décidée ou ne s'est pas imposée\" (page 14). Appeler à la tolérance pour ceux qui sont différents, c'est bien. Mais là, cela va bien au-delà, il s'agit d'établir une nouvelle norme. Il est explicitement dit qu'il faut s'adresser aux enfants les plus jeunes possibles. C'est introduire de la confusion dans leur esprit, alors que pour la grande majorité d'entre eux aujourd'hui, les choses sont claires.\nQuand l'école ne défend plus les valeurs communes, mais des valeurs communautaires, les parents s'inquiètent.\nhttp://www.snuipp.fr/IMG/pdf/document_telechargeable-2013-30-05.pdf\n"}

{"comment_id":"content_134222785","time":"20140129231212Z","id":"content_134222785","content":"Here's why JJ has been so successful: he has found that rare combination with his crew chief, Chad Knaus, where this team generally gets the best setup for his car.  JJ and Chad know each other that well.   If JJ didn't have Chad, he wouldn't win as much as he has.  It's like when Jeff Gordon had Ray Evernham; that combo clicked.  When Ray left, Jeff never had the same level of super success, even though he did win one more championship.  If Ray had stayed with Jeff, I think Jeff would have had at least 1 or 2 more championships.  He may have gotten to 7 even.\n\nNow JJ is a great driver, no doubt, and he is very technically skilled at what he does.  But he's not the type of driver who can win races by outdriving others, even when he doesn't have the best car.  You won't see highlights of his wins that match up to some of the wins by King Richard, Dale Sr, etc.  Right now the best pure drivers on the circuit IMHO are probably Tony Stewart, Kevin Harvick, Kyle and Kurt Busch.  These guys are wheel men...they can race anything with wheels, and they create victories in close situations.  By contrast, there were a few races last year where JJ arguably should have won, but botched the closing laps and restarts under pressure.\n\nFor instance, give JJ and Tony Stewart equal equipment, and if it comes down to those 2 in the last 20 laps, it is very likely that Tony will prevail. \n\nSo you have a prescription for a boring competition: the guy who wins the most has a bland personality, and the way he wins is in a rather boring fashion.  Now that's no fault of JJ or Chad; I give them props for achieving what they have.  That's their job.\n\nBut Nascar is a sport and like any sport it is in the business of entertainment.  Most sports generate the most interest when they have a lot of competition, not just when one competitor dominates.  Sometimes having one dominant competitor can work, but that requires the dominant person or team to have a really great personality and style of play with the public.  Think Michael Jordan for example.   The public loved Michael dominating, because of the way he won.\n\nOf course in Nascar you have an incredible list of people like Dale Sr, King Richard, David Pearson, Darrel Waltrip, etc.  Now these drivers had such a strong personality and driving style that it helped build the sport.  No one will ever say that JJ's personality will help build the sport.\n\nObjectively JJ's dominance in the Chase is a problem for Nascar's popularity.\n"}

{"comment_id":"content_134223052","time":"20140129231326Z","id":"content_134223052","content":"johnnyFisherman I liked the way things have been going with Motorola too. It's been great to see Google's influence on the company. Even though I'm a bit sad to see them sell it, I'm not mad about it. Google has taken a lot of heat about getting into the hardware business and competing against other manufacturers who use Android. They probably felt a lot of pressure to sell, especially because the new Moto X/G phones are very good devices. I know Motorola is not doing the greatest financially but they are turning things around, and that only puts more pressure on Google. We can hope that Lenovo will continue on this path and let Motorola move forward as it has. They could do great things with it, just as Google has. However, people getting mad and leaving for other OSes isn't going to help anything get better. Android is still my prefered choice because it's one of the most flexible OSes there is. I think it will be connecting us to all kinds of different products in the future.\n"}

What you wrote as only MILDLY true and it ignores a problem with black men and white women -who go interracial- that is similar to when men with money dumb their wives and marry much younger women. Love is not the motivation in most of these May/December unions and the respective familes and outsiders \"camps\" of The Young and The Old folks RIGHTLY disapprove of these couples.\nIt also hurts middle aged women in that class or social circle. Its too easy to say \"Its about love\"- when there is a pattern in the choices of white women, black men, and asian women that say this is about something else.\n{BTW- I'm not against interrracial love or dating anymore than I am against people with an age gap dating. I am against prejudice and fixations ,and race/age fetishism, and social climbing- that is called love.}\n"}

It simply is not true.     \nAdditionally, I am more impressed with acts of kindness that are internally driven because they are simply the right thing to do, rather than because it is what some deity expects you to do.  Anyone that must ask \"WWJD\" ought to be able to figure out the right thing to do without having to consult Jesus.\n"}

This way, more cap space would be left for assembling the proper supporting cast he seems to desperately need. \n\nI know many will say it's stupid to not opt out, and his agent will certainly insist he do so, but in a hard cap league, the real stupidity would be to pay one player so much that there can be no high-quality team built around that player. Would the Knicks' management broach such a topic with Melo? Would it be insulting?"}

Any doubts about the momentous nature of the \nchanges were wiped away when we arrived in\nPoland on July 9 and in Hungary 2 days later.\nThe Hungarians were \nchallenging Soviet power directly and moving toward multiparty \nelections. More astonishingly, Hungary had decided to dismantle the \nbarbed wire demarcating its borders with Austria.\nCommunism in Poland had lost its ferocity.\nIt was clear that the \nparty's demise was sealed the next day when we went to the city of \nGdansk, the home of Solidarity. President Bush was greeted in the town \nsquare by hundreds of thousands of cheering\nPolish workers. \"Bush, Bush, Bush!\" they chanted, waving American flags.\n \"Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!\"\nI turned to a colleague and said, \"I\n don't think this is what Karl Marx had in mind when he said, 'Workers \nof the world, unite.'\"\n\nSource: http://www.ontheissues.org/Condi_Family.htm\n, Jan 10, 2012\n"}

Usually if we saw one approaching we would slowly make our way out the room as if there is something we wanted from the kitchen. To only stand in the passage to watch. The folks who were talking aloud oblivious to the movie suddenly go quiet. The one brave enough to stay behind wasn't smart enough to realise lowering the volume would bring attention to him. Then my father would mumble \"Ithini iage restriction?\". Before any answer was forthcoming they would be instructed to switch off the darn tv. And bring the bible kuzobulelwa. But when Dlem was watching that shit wouldn't fly. Even our exit strategy would be compromised cause she would tell us to stay with a nod of the head. To make matters worse she would even increase the volume to drown the folks voices. In disbelief they would stare at her, as to rebuke her. Her response, a simple \"iyafundisa lemovie\". That seemed to do the trick, as we would watch without pause. On odd occasions father would ask what we learnt ke. To state the actress has beautiful breasts just wouldn't do. So we settled for we were sleepy when were watching so we don't remember quite well.\n"}

Doesn't mean Melo will stay or go, he may not be decided yet.\n\nIf Melo wants to a) retire a Knick, and b) win a championship, wouldn't the best way to accomplish both of these goals be to NOT opt out? This way, more cap space would be left for assembling the proper supporting cast he seems to desperately need. \n\nI know many will say it's stupid to not opt out, and his agent will certainly insist he do so, but in a hard cap league, the real stupidity would be to pay one player so much that there can be no high-quality team built around that player. Would the Knicks' management broach such a topic with Melo? Would it be insulting to do so?"}

I followed her and the man she was with and asked the woman if her name was Lilly. She said yes but that she didn't think she knew me. I said that I knew her when she was little (she's the spitting image of her mom). She still couldn't place me so I started singing the Beatles \"I've Just Seen a Face\". She looked like she was going to fall over. She said she thought That I was dead. A guy with the same first and last name died in a car wreck and a few people that hadn't seen me around thought it was me. Evidently, her mom was one of them. She used to sit on my lap when she was a child and I taught her the lyrics to a bunch of Beatles songs. We talked for over a half an hour. Her husband said she still sang Beatles songs when she was working around the house and that their son sings them too.\nSadly her mom passed away several years ago. They'd moved away almost 25 years ago and just recently moved back into the area.\nMovietime. Good night folks.That put me in a good mood.\n"}

We are supposed to be the leaders of the free world yet our ignorance and poor education constantly bring us down. My question to the ignorant people is: What is the point? You will not change anything the world was meant to mix that's why we are the same species and are able to produce viable offspring (this is science by the way...just in case anyone is lost as I'm sure you are). Your stupidity makes our country look bad. The world was meant to evolve the idea of a pure race doesn't serve a purpose. Natural selection will continue what it has being doing all the time; weeding out the weak and supporting the strong. Therefore all you ignorant people will eventually die out. Stupidity is a weakness :-)\n"}

Careful Bodo, you're gonna convince 'em all that you're a KAD again.\nSeriously, I remember the NYT article touching on this game wonderingly too. I had a thought or two like Pete's too. Who knows? Nadal has been buried plenty of times, but this is one of the subtler ways. With Fed, we were always saying \"well, you know, getting to match point means he was essentially there\" in 2011, the Year of a Thousand Collapses from MP Up. And then, well, he sharpened in 2012, vastly dullened in 2013, and now who knows? \n\nIt is, though, the first time I've seen something so totally Fed-like -- 3 BPs given away instantly -- from the Nad end of the court. Notable. (Of course, Fed has given away BPs his whole career.) Perhaps something else along these lines to note was Rafa's difficulty in breaking Fed in the SF. He finished that one with Fedlike BP numbers too."}

Fan support was declining and the local and state governments wouldn't go in on a new arena. Public sentiment goes a long way toward making that happen,and in this case it apparently wasn't enough. The franchise is healthier in Oklahoma City, for God's sake! Sorry, but that's just lame. \n\nFor the record, a lot more than Peyton Manning stands in the way.\n"}

He gave and will give Stan full credit), but there's too little attention being paid to the fact that Stan said he had noticed that something was wrong w/Nadal during the prematch warmup. As for losing that first set being the moment when Rafa's career jumped the shark, you're right (of course), we'll just have to wait and see, but before you attribute too much importance to the outcome of that first set, take a look at the FedEx stats on the ATP site that show Rafa has the highest career winning percentage of anyone after losing the first set (83.7%),higher than both Federer and Djokovic. Stan was playing very well, it's true. But the match would have been far, far from over if Rafa hadn't been injured.  Even when it became clear that Rafa's play was being compromised by what he was going through physically he somehow managed to win the third.  Darren Cahill said at the time, \"we're watching one the great problem-solvers in our sport trying to figure out a way, somehow, to win this thing.\"And as for this AO being \"a potentially legacy-shaping event in Nadal's career,\" I think you're indulging in wishful thinking, Pete, like many other Fed fans. Nothing's certain in sports, but I'd never want to be the one holding serious money on Nadal never being able to catch or surpass 18 majors. There's way too much time left on the clock. And the kid from Mallorca is probably the most intense competitor the sport has seen since Borg (no wonder Mac would love a chance to work with him).\n"}

The same story I filmed at the DAV Convention in August when he told Cory's story in detail.  The same day that Michelle Obama told the story of Marine Cpl. Winder Perez wounded with a live RPG in his leg. Of the Marines risking their lives to save his, of the helicopter crew risking their's and the bomb tech risking her life. This was and is about the thousands of wounded coming home that do not receive a tenth of the attention they should have all the time. You want to ignore all that and trivialize this expression of gratitude held for those who serve and that, that was a despicable moment when you made the choice to make your thoughts pubic.\n"}
